# Hacker Key

A **Hacker Key** decoder/generator

</div>

> The Hacker Key Guide was inspired by Robert Hayden's excellent Geek Code which has been a long time hacker favorite.  However, the Geek Code has not been updated in a long time, and although the commercialization of the Internet has washed away much of the old hacker environment (MUDs, BBSes, DOS...), we must attempt to keep hacker traditions alive, by reimplementation if needed.
